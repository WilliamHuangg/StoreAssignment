Submitted by: **William Huang**

Deployed Application (optional): [Student Store Deployed Site](ADD_LINK_HERE)

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [X] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [X] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [X] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [X] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [X] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt the labs were very helpful towards completing the assignment, especially the third lab. I relied on the videos to start the assignment and referenced them whenever I was stuck. I felt unprepared to complete the creating orders and saving it to a JSON file. I understand how to add to a JSON file through insomnia but was confused on how to add the orders if there were multiple items. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would definitely work on the stretch features. I would also touch up on the css and make my webstore more clean looking. Maybe would have added a page to allow the user to add more products to the store.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think I did well on explaining the features of my assignment to my peers. I was able to tell them what I have completed and what my next steps were. I noticed some of my peers mention their focus on the css portion which I would like to work on next time. My peer's stores were really good looking where everyone's was layed oujt differently which made them unique.

### Shout out

I want to shout out my mentor Forrest for helping me understand node express and react a bit more. He was able to break it down and explain his view of how express and react work together. Also want to shout out the lab videos from this week. They were extremely helpful in explaining the concepts.
